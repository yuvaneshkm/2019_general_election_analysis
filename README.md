# 2019 General Election Analysis

## Overview
* In this exciting Data Analysis project, we dive into the world of data and Python to uncover valuable insights from the vast and dynamic universe of General Elections.
* With over 600 Million voters voting for 8500+ candidates across 543 constituencies, the general elections in the world's largest democracy are a potential goldmine of data. While there are existing separate datasets about the votes each candidate received and the personal information of each candidate, there was no comprehensive dataset that included both these information. Thus, this dataset will provide more usability than most existing datasets in this domain.
* In this project we use Python's powerful libraries and techniques to process, and visualize the data. By the end of the
project, we will have a comprehensive understanding of data analysis and how it can be applied to derive meaningful information from the data.

## Installation
* The entire Code is written in Python 3.11.0 using Anaconda and jupyter notebook.
**Requirements**
* Anaconda
* Jupyter notebook of version 6.5.4
* Python 3.11.0

**Ensuring you have the latest version of conda.** 
* To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository.

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```


## Key highlights of the project include:

**Data Collection:** The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle.

**Data Preprocessing:** Discover the significance of data preprocessing and cleansing to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
We'll cover techniques like handling missing data, converting data types, and dealing with duplicates etc..

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We'll create insightful visualizations to gain a better understanding of the dataset.
